## Expressions
- Evaluates expressions of the form `(<op> <value>)`
  - `<op>` is the mathematical operation
  - `<value>` is a number or another expression
### Questions
1. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da569354-d153-4b36-a2f0-b3c79e88905b) Write expression to evaluate.
(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))
2. If you see #$i2.718281828459045$ appear in the interaction pane, it means:
It's a number very close to 2.718281828459045. Explanation: The number is irrational, that is the number is not repeating and cannot be shown in a finite number of digits. This is the method employed to show numbers of this kind in BSL.
3. Which of the following are expressions:
(+ 2 3), (sqrt 2), #i1.4142135623730951, 1. Explanation: expressions can be numbers as well as valid BSL expression.
4. Which of the following are values:
#i1.4142135623730951, 1. Explanation: numerical values.
5. What would be the result of evaluating the following expression: `(/ (* 2 3) (- 3 1))`
Answer will be 3. Explanation: First we get the division operator followed by two expressions, say `exp1` and `exp2`. So the division operator implies we have to compute `exp1/exp2`. For that we evaluate the individual expressions, which follows standard BSL syntax.
6. Which of these expressions produces the average of the numbers 4, 6.2 and -12?
(/ (+ 4 6.2 -12) 3). Explanation: although other options were also correct, this looked like the most easily understandable.
## Evaluation
- When an opening and closing parenthesis is found in the expression that start with an operator, a **primitive call** is made, which works on reducing all **operands** to values.
- Works sequentially from left to right after the operator, reducing the left-most operand to values (doesn't do anything if the operand is already a value)
### Questions
1. Consider the following expression: `(* (- 4 2) 3)` Select all calls to primitives. Answer: `(* (- 4 2) 3)`, `(- 4 2)`
2. Consider the following expression: `(* (- 4 2) 3)` Select all operators. Answer: *, -.
3. Consider the following expression: `(* (- 4 2) 3)` Select all operands. Answer: (- 4 2), 3, 4, 2
4. What is the next step in the following evaluation?  
Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))
Answer: Step 2: (/ 12 (+ 3 3))
5. What is the next step in the following evaluation?  
Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 2: (/ 12 (+ 3 3))
Answer: Step 3: (/ 12 6)
6. What is the next step in the following evaluation?  
Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 2: (/ 12 (+ 3 3))  
Step 3: (/ 12 6)
Answer: 2.
## Strings and Images
- Two more primitives other than numbers
- Strings start and end with double quotes as `"<string>>"`
	- `(string-append <str1> <str2>)` appends the two strings
	- `(string-length <str>)` gives the length of the string
	- `(substring <str> i j)` takes a substring of `<str>` starting from the `i` upto (excluding) `j`. Zero-indexing applies.
 - To use images, we must add the required library using `(require 2htdp/image)`
	- To generate a circle: `(circle <radius> <type> <color>)` here type and color are both strings while radius is numerical. Type can be outline or solid.
	- To generate a rectangle: `(rectangle <width> <height> <type> <color>)`
	- To generate a text from a string: `(text <str> <color>)`
 	- To generate a regular (equilateral) polygon: `(regular-polygon <length> <sides> <type> <color>)`
- `above` and `beside` operations take images and forms a stack horizontally or vertically respectively. It has the form `(above <img1> <img2>)`
- `(overlay <img1> <img2>)` overlays two images, the first on top.
### Questions
1. What is the value of the expression below? `(substring "hello" 1 3)` Answer: "el"
2. Will the following produce any errors? `(string-append "1" "2")` Answer: No, it will just result in the string "12".
3. Which primitive is required in the following expression to produce the stop sign image below? `(_______ (text "STOP" 48 "white")  (regular-polygon 60 8 "solid" "red"))` Answer: overlay
4. Which image will the following expression produce? `(beside (square 20 "outline" "blue") (above (circle 15 "solid" "red") (triangle 20 "solid" "green")))` Answer: It will be outlined blue square at the left, with the right being a stacked image of a solid red circle atop a solid green triangle.
5. Assume that the image below shows an entire program file. Why does running the program produce the following error? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70e4481-36f7-4698-a734-a31f82d2da81) Answer:We didn't include `(require 2htdp/image)` at the beginning of the program.
6. We have revised the program now, why are we still getting an error? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33905a18-099f-47c4-90be-a0d050b01569) Answer: Bruh.
### Create your own image
`(require 2htdp/image)
(overlay (circle 100 "outline" "red") (above (beside
(overlay (circle 8 "solid" "yellow") (regular-polygon 20 6 "solid" "blue")) (rectangle 40 20 "solid" "white")
(overlay (circle 8 "solid" "yellow") (regular-polygon 20 6 "solid" "blue"))) (rectangle 40 50 "solid" "white")
                                       (circle 10 "solid" "black")))
`

## Constant definitions
- `(define VARNAME <value>)`: assigns value to VARNAME variable
	- The variables defined in this way can be used anywhere a in place of a value in the program. Evaluation of the statement will be as we learned before: left to right and in to out, with each variable name evaluated as the value assigned to it.
	- Constants defined cannot be changed (?)
### Questions
1. Consider the following program: `(define FOO (* 2 3))  
(define BAR (* FOO 2))  
(* FOO BAR)`  
What result is produced when the program is run? Answer: 72
2. Consider the following program: `(define FOO (* 2 3))  
(define BAR (* FOO 2))  
(* FOO BAR)`
What is the first evaluation step? Answer: The first define with the constant FOO is evaluated as `(define FOO 6)`, which is the first step.
