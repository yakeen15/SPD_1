# Beginning Student Language
## Expressions
- Evaluates expressions of the form `(<op> <value>)`
  - `<op>` is the mathematical operation
  - `<value>` is a number or another expression
### Questions
1. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/da569354-d153-4b36-a2f0-b3c79e88905b) Write expression to evaluate.
(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))
2. If you see #$i2.718281828459045$ appear in the interaction pane, it means:
It's a number very close to 2.718281828459045. Explanation: The number is irrational, that is the number is not repeating and cannot be shown in a finite number of digits. This is the method employed to show numbers of this kind in BSL.
3. Which of the following are expressions:
(+ 2 3), (sqrt 2), #i1.4142135623730951, 1. Explanation: expressions can be numbers as well as valid BSL expression.
4. Which of the following are values:
#i1.4142135623730951, 1. Explanation: numerical values.
5. What would be the result of evaluating the following expression: `(/ (* 2 3) (- 3 1))`
Answer will be 3. Explanation: First we get the division operator followed by two expressions, say `exp1` and `exp2`. So the division operator implies we have to compute `exp1/exp2`. For that we evaluate the individual expressions, which follows standard BSL syntax.
6. Which of these expressions produces the average of the numbers 4, 6.2 and -12?
(/ (+ 4 6.2 -12) 3). Explanation: although other options were also correct, this looked like the most easily understandable.
## Evaluation
- When an opening and closing parenthesis is found in the expression that start with an operator, a **primitive call** is made, which works on reducing all **operands** to values.
- Works sequentially from left to right after the operator, reducing the left-most operand to values (doesn't do anything if the operand is already a value)

Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))
Answer: Step 2: (/ 12 (+ 3 3))
5. What is the next step in the following evaluation?  
Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 2: (/ 12 (+ 3 3))
Answer: Step 3: (/ 12 6)
6. What is the next step in the following evaluation?  
Step 0: (/ (* 3 4) (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 1: (/ 12 (+ (- 7 4) 3))  
Step 2: (/ 12 (+ 3 3))  
Step 3: (/ 12 6)
Answer: 2.
## Strings and Images
- Two more primitives other than numbers
- Strings start and end with double quotes as `"<string>>"`
	- `(string-append <str1> <str2>)` appends the two strings
	- `(string-length <str>)` gives the length of the string
	- `(substring <str> i j)` takes a substring of `<str>` starting from the `i` upto (excluding) `j`. Zero-indexing applies.
 - To use images, we must add the required library using `(require 2htdp/image)`
	- To generate a circle: `(circle <radius> <type> <color>)` here type and color are both strings while radius is numerical. Type can be outline or solid.
	- To generate a rectangle: `(rectangle <width> <height> <type> <color>)`
	- To generate a text from a string: `(text <str> <color>)`
 	- To generate a regular (equilateral) polygon: `(regular-polygon <length> <sides> <type> <color>)`
- `above` and `beside` operations take images and forms a stack horizontally or vertically respectively. It has the form `(above <img1> <img2>)`
- `(overlay <img1> <img2>)` overlays two images, the first on top.
### Questions
1. What is the value of the expression below? `(substring "hello" 1 3)` Answer: "el"
2. Will the following produce any errors? `(string-append "1" "2")` Answer: No, it will just result in the string "12".
3. Which primitive is required in the following expression to produce the stop sign image below? `(_______ (text "STOP" 48 "white")  (regular-polygon 60 8 "solid" "red"))` Answer: overlay
4. Which image will the following expression produce? `(beside (square 20 "outline" "blue") (above (circle 15 "solid" "red") (triangle 20 "solid" "green")))` Answer: It will be outlined blue square at the left, with the right being a stacked image of a solid red circle atop a solid green triangle.
5. Assume that the image below shows an entire program file. Why does running the program produce the following error? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70e4481-36f7-4698-a734-a31f82d2da81) Answer:We didn't include `(require 2htdp/image)` at the beginning of the program.
6. We have revised the program now, why are we still getting an error? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33905a18-099f-47c4-90be-a0d050b01569) Answer: Bruh.
### Create your own image
`(require 2htdp/image)
(overlay (circle 100 "outline" "red") (above (beside
(overlay (circle 8 "solid" "yellow") (regular-polygon 20 6 "solid" "blue")) (rectangle 40 20 "solid" "white")
(overlay (circle 8 "solid" "yellow") (regular-polygon 20 6 "solid" "blue"))) (rectangle 40 50 "solid" "white")
                                       (circle 10 "solid" "black")))
`

## Constant definitions
- `(define VARNAME <value>)`: assigns value to VARNAME variable
	- The variables defined in this way can be used anywhere a in place of a value in the program. Evaluation of the statement will be as we learned before: left to right and in to out, with each variable name evaluated as the value assigned to it.
	- Constants defined cannot be changed (?)
 - Images can be pasted in for definition of constants
	- `(define VAR <pasted image>)`
	- Rotate D degrees using `(rotate D VAR)`
### Questions
1. Consider the following program: `(define FOO (* 2 3))  
(define BAR (* FOO 2))  
(* FOO BAR)`  
What result is produced when the program is run? Answer: 72
2. Consider the following program: `(define FOO (* 2 3))  
(define BAR (* FOO 2))  
(* FOO BAR)`
What is the first evaluation step? Answer: The first define with the constant FOO is evaluated as `(define FOO 6)`, which is the first step.
## Function definitions
- To define a function, use `(define (FUNCNAME PARAMETER) <body of the function> )`, where PARAMETER is the function input or the parameters the function takes which is used in the function body
- To invoke the function use `(FUNCNAME <value>)`
### Questions
1. Why should you use function definitions? Answer: To avoid duplicated code (also, to be lazy, also to make the code easier to read)
2. Suppose we want a function that will give the length of the hypotenuse of any right angle triangle. Which of the following would achieve that? Answer: `(define (pythag a b) (sqrt (+ (sqr a) (sqr b))))`
3. What should we do to fix the following error: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4bf784a9-3819-4de9-9b67-74d4b8d45eb6) Answer: Replace i with img, which is the name of the parameter for this function
4. Given the function: `(define (foo a b) (+ (* 3 a) b (* b a)))`
What is the first step of the evaluation of (foo (+ 1 1) 4), and what is the result of that step? Answer: Evaluate (+ 1 1) and replace it in the function call of foo.
5. After the previous step, what is the next step? Answer: Replace `(foo 2 4)` with its body, replacing a by 2 and b by 4
6. After the previous step, what is the next step? Answer: (* 3 2) is replaced with 6.
7. After the previous step, what is the next step? Answer: (* 4 2) is replaced with 8.
8. After the previous step, what is the next step? Answer: 6, 4, and 8 are added to produce 18.
## Booleans and if Expressions
- `(> <val1> <val2>)` returns true or false depending on if val1 is greater than val2
- predicates are things that return true or false values
- If expression works as follows `(if <predicate> <procedure for true> <procedure for false>)`
- Evaluation of an if expression
	- see if the question is already a value or not, if not evaluate it
	- if the evaluation leads to true execute the true procedure, vice versa
	- if the evaluation leads to some other value produce error
 - We can use `and` `or` and `not` as such
	- `(and <expr1> <expr2>)`: produces true if all expr are true, false otherwise
	- `(or <expr1> <expr2>)`: produces true if one expr is true, false otherwise
	- `(not <expr>)`: produces true if expr is false, vice versa
### Questions
1. What is the value of the expression below? `(> 10 5)` Answer: true
2. What about this one? `(> 5 5)` Answer: false
3. Which of the following are predicates? Select all that apply. Answer: =, string=? Explanation: Predicates produce boolean values
4. Which of the following expressions produces true only when the width of an image IMG1 is greater than 50 pixels? Answer: `(> (image-width IMG1) 50)`
5. How can we fix the following error: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee9d6bf6-332d-48e4-8bc0-cab84adc1242) Answer: Add ')' after (image-width I2)
6. What is the value of the if expression below? `(if (> (string-length "hello") 10) "long" "short")` Answer: short
7. What is the value of the expression below? `(or (< 2 1) (> 3 2) (= 4 4))` Answer: true
8. Which comparisons are performed when the expression below is evaluated? `(or (< 2 1) (> 3 2) (= 4 4))` Answer: The first two. Explanation: Because after the second one a true is produced, which immediately stops the or operation and returns a true value
9.  `(define B1 true) (define B2 false)` What is the value of the expression below? `(or (not B1) B2)` Answer: false
## Using the Stepper
- We can use the Step option in DrRacket to show evaluation steps for our program

## Discovering primitives
- Guessing: after programming in BSL it is possible to guess what the name for a useful primitive (if it exists in BSL) should be
- Search and scroll: bring up the help desk and scroll through it manually to find the required primitives
